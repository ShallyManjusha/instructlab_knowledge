# SEC Regulatory Updates - May 2025

## Marketing Rule FAQ Updates (March 19, 2025)

The SEC's Division of Investment Management has updated its Marketing Compliance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) regarding Rule 206(4)-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Marketing Rule). These updates provide new interpretative guidance on:

- Presentation of extracted performance data
- Performance-related characteristics

### New FAQ #1: Extracted Performance

**Definition**: Extracted performance refers to displaying the performance of one investment or a group of investments in a private fund or other portfolio.

**Previous Requirement**: If an adviser shows gross performance of one or more investments in an advertisement, they must also show net performance of such investments.

**Updated Guidance**: The Division will not recommend enforcement action if an adviser displays gross performance without corresponding net performance if:

- The extracted performance is clearly identified as gross performance
- The advertisement includes the total portfolio's gross and net performance consistent with Marketing Rule requirements
- The total portfolio's performance is presented with at least equal prominence and in a manner facilitating comparison
- The total portfolio's performance covers a period that includes the entire period of the extracted performance calculation

### New FAQ #2: Performance-Related Characteristics

**Examples**: Yield, coupon rate, contribution to return, volatility, sector or geographic returns, attribution analyses, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, etc.

**Issue Addressed**: Advisers were uncertain whether these characteristics qualified as "performance" under the Marketing Rule, and calculating net versions could be impossible or misleading.

**Updated Guidance**: The Division will not recommend enforcement action if an adviser presents gross characteristics without net characteristics if:

- The gross characteristic is clearly identified as being calculated without deduction of fees and expenses
- The advertisement includes the total portfolio's gross and net performance consistent with rule requirements
- The total portfolio's performance is presented with at least equal prominence and facilitates comparison
- The total portfolio's performance covers a period that includes the entire period of the characteristic calculation

**Note on Time Periods**: For both FAQs, the Division acknowledges that time periods may not easily align with those required by the Marketing Rule and will not recommend enforcement action if information is calculated over a single, clearly disclosed period.

## Key Takeaways from Marketing Rule Updates

1. The guidance addresses challenges advisers faced when attempting to calculate net performance in certain scenarios
2. The first FAQ represents a significant departure from prior SEC guidance on extracted performance
3. The second FAQ avoids determining whether specific characteristics qualify as "performance," providing flexibility
4. Despite the new guidance, advisers should remain vigilant in their compliance efforts

## Names Rule Compliance Date Extension (May 2025)

The SEC has announced a six-month extension for compliance with amendments to the Investment Company Act "Names Rule" (adopted September 2023).

### Updated Compliance Dates

- **Larger fund groups**: Extended from December 11, 2025, to June 11, 2026
- **Smaller fund groups**: Extended from June 11, 2026, to December 11, 2026

### Rationale for Extension

- Balance investor benefits with funds' implementation needs
- Allow time to develop and finalize compliance systems
- Provide opportunity to test compliance plans
- Align compliance dates with annual disclosure and reporting obligations tied to fund fiscal year-end to help avoid additional costs
