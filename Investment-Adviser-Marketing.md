# SEC Regulatory Updates - May 2025

## Marketing Rule FAQ Updates (March 19, 2025)

The SEC's Division of Investment Management has updated its Marketing Compliance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) regarding Rule 206(4)-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Marketing Rule). These updates provide new interpretative guidance on:

- Presentation of extracted performance data
- Performance-related characteristics

### New FAQ #1: Extracted Performance

**Definition**: Extracted performance refers to displaying the performance of one investment or a group of investments in a private fund or other portfolio.

**Previous Requirement**: If an adviser shows gross performance of one or more investments in an advertisement, they must also show net performance of such investments.

**Updated Guidance**: The Division will not recommend enforcement action if an adviser displays gross performance without corresponding net performance if:

- The extracted performance is clearly identified as gross performance
- The advertisement includes the total portfolio's gross and net performance consistent with Marketing Rule requirements
- The total portfolio's performance is presented with at least equal prominence and in a manner facilitating comparison
- The total portfolio's performance covers a period that includes the entire period of the extracted performance calculation

### New FAQ #2: Performance-Related Characteristics

**Examples**: Yield, coupon rate, contribution to return, volatility, sector or geographic returns, attribution analyses, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, etc.

**Issue Addressed**: Advisers were uncertain whether these characteristics qualified as "performance" under the Marketing Rule, and calculating net versions could be impossible or misleading.

**Updated Guidance**: The Division will not recommend enforcement action if an adviser presents gross characteristics without net characteristics if:

- The gross characteristic is clearly identified as being calculated without deduction of fees and expenses
- The advertisement includes the total portfolio's gross and net performance consistent with rule requirements
- The total portfolio's performance is presented with at least equal prominence and facilitates comparison
- The total portfolio's performance covers a period that includes the entire period of the characteristic calculation

**Note on Time Periods**: For both FAQs, the Division acknowledges that time periods may not easily align with those required by the Marketing Rule and will not recommend enforcement action if information is calculated over a single, clearly disclosed period.

## Key Takeaways from Marketing Rule Updates

1. The guidance addresses challenges advisers faced when attempting to calculate net performance in certain scenarios
2. The first FAQ represents a significant departure from prior SEC guidance on extracted performance
3. The second FAQ avoids determining whether specific characteristics qualify as "performance," providing flexibility
4. Despite the new guidance, advisers should remain vigilant in their compliance efforts

# SEC Adopts Amendments to Investment Company Act "Names Rule"

**Washington D.C., Sept. 20, 2023** —  
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today adopted amendments to the Investment Company Act “Names Rule,” aimed at addressing fund names that may mislead investors about a fund’s investments and associated risks. These amendments modernize and strengthen the Names Rule to align with developments in the fund industry over the past two decades and further the SEC’s investor protection goals.

> “As the fund industry has developed over the last two decades, gaps in the current Names Rule may undermine investor protection,” said **SEC Chair Gary Gensler**. “Today’s final rules will help ensure that a fund’s portfolio aligns with a fund’s name. Such truth in advertising promotes fund integrity on behalf of fund investors.”

## Key Points of the Amendments

- **Expanded 80% Investment Policy**:  
  Funds whose names suggest a focus on certain investments or characteristics (e.g., “growth,” “value,” ESG factors) must adopt a policy to invest at least 80% of the value of their assets in accordance with that focus.

- **Quarterly Portfolio Review**:  
  Funds must review their compliance with the 80% investment policy at least **quarterly**.

- **Compliance Time Frames**:  
  Funds must come back into compliance within **90 days** if they fall out of alignment with the 80% investment requirement.

- **Plain English & Industry Terminology**:  
  Terms used in fund names must reflect their **plain English meaning** or have a clearly **established industry use**.

- **Enhanced Disclosure and Recordkeeping**:  
  - Additional **prospectus disclosures** required for fund name terminology.  
  - New **reporting and recordkeeping** requirements to document compliance with name-related rules.

## Implementation Timeline

- **Effective Date**:  
  60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

- **Compliance Period**:  
  - Fund groups with **≥ $1 billion** in net assets: **24 months** to comply.  
  - Fund groups with **< $1 billion** in net assets: **30 months** to comply.
